								<h2>PROGRAMS</h2>
								<p>
								Food Not Bombs is running the following 5 programs:
								<ul>
									<li>Collective garden: FNB is running a collective garden in Garneau.  The vegetables from this garden will go towards making meals for the unhoused folks in the city as well as for low-income folks.  This increases our capacity for and commitment to food sovereignty.</li>
									<li>Street Outreach YEG: We are running a joint meal program with our ally, the Workers' Liberation Coalition, to provide holistic meals to the unhoused community.</li>
									<li>Community fridge: FNB is running a fridge outside Earth's General Store on Whyte Avenue to provide people with access to free vegan food in a way that is discreet, accessible, and easy for people to donate to</li>
									<li>Fruit collection: From the month of August to November, we run a program where we collect fruit from people's yards that would otherwise go to waste, using it for meals for people in need.</li>
									<li>Helping The Humans: Our biggest commitment at this time, we have served several hundred households with nutritious vegan meals for free in order to ensure food security for the community.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>POLITICAL ACTIVITIES</h2>

								<p>While we are dedicated to mutual aid, we also need to raise awareness about the problems in our society and participate in activities that push us toward a solution and a societal shift.  Some of our political activities lately have involved giving hampers and food out and providing logistical support at Red Dress Day, a day raising awareness for Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women, and a meal in opposition to the Flu Trux Klan where we served hot drinks and literature and helped distribute donation links for Ukraine.

								<h2>HOW TO HELP</h2>
								<o>FNB YEG needs donations of money and vegan food to continue doing our work.  We also need committed volunteers who are willing to cook, serve food, and manage social media accounts.  Message on Facebook or Instagram or at foodnotbombsedmonton@gmail.com for more info!

							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<p class="lead"> With over a billion people going hungry each day how can we spend another dollar on war?
								</p>
								<p>Food Not Bombs is an international organization dedicated to fighting hunger, poverty, and war. We believe that it is unconscionable that billions of dollars are spent on murder and repression while billions of people go hungry. Rather than wasting time, money, and energy on the futile task of asking politicans to change their policies, Food Not Bombs directly creates a better world, starting in our own communities.</p>
								<p>
								1 in every 8 housholds in Canada is food insecure. The cause is not laziness, stupidity, or lack of education.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="https://proof.utoronto.ca/food-insecurity/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> Children miss meals every day because of systemic poverty and waste caused by irresponsible government and corporate greed. More than 58% of the food produced in our country is wasted,<sup id="fnref2"><a href="https://secondharvest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Avoidable-Crisis-of-Food-Waste-The-Roadmap-by-Second-Harvest-and-VCMI.pdf" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup> and much of that waste is intentional and completely unnecessary. Food is thrown away, destroyed, or poisoned by big agribusiness, corporate grocers, and restaurants in order to keep prices high. Food Not Bombs directly responds to this waste by recovering perfectly good food that would otherwise be thrown away, ensuring its quality, and preparing and serving healthy meals to those most in need.</p>
								<p>
								While over 4 million households suffer from hunger, our federal government spends $21.9 billion of our money on death and destruction.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/transition-materials/defence-101/2020/03/defence-101/defence-budget.html" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup> Despite a dearth of national security threats, military spending increases year after year after year, with over $233 million earmarked directly for terrorizing other countries such as Ukraine and Afghanistan. This money may be numbers on a spreadsheet to O’Toole or Trudeau, but for millions of Canadian children, it’s meals stolen directly from out of their mouths, and for children abroad, it’s fire and death rained down upon their heads. Food Not Bombs directly opposes wasteful military spending on bombing the Middle East,<sup id="fnref4"><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/operations/military-operations/current-operations/operation-impact.html" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup> giving military equipment to cops,<sup id="fnref5"><a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/police-weapons/canada.php" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup> and stirring up trouble abroad.</p>
								<p>
								Food Not Bombs is not a charity. We do not believe that hunger is some eternal problem that can only be addressed by the altruism of the rich and powerful. Rather, hunger is caused by the rich and powerful. The hunger and want caused by greed, waste, hate, and callousness can only be addressed by the people themselves working together to achieve sustainable food sovereignty for themselves. Food Not Bombs is on the front lines of this struggle, directly recovering food that would otherwise go to waste and providing fresh, healthy, vegan meals for anyone who is hungry.</p>
